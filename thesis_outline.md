# A mini macro ABM

This project aims to build a configurable toolkit for rapidly experimenting with macroeconomic agent based models. 
It aims to offer a whole economy in a toolkit, using YAML based configs to allow for fully configurable agents and simulations. These simulations are both exceedingly finicky and inherently stateful, making this a bit of a pain. 

The purpose for this project is to fill a gap in the current ecosystem of models and toolkits. Right now there exist some software packages (Mesa, JABM) and a number of full-blown models. What is lacking is something in the middle; a configurable toolkit built specifically for MABM simulations that allows for easy configuration and execution of pre-set models, agents, agent behaviours etc. with some ability to customize further. 

This toolkit is designed for rapid experimentation. The point is to allow us to *play* with these models; this is then a tool for idea generation moreso than one for building full-scale research-grade models. 

The foundational papers on which this work stands are:
-  The two reviews by Dawid and Delli Gatti where they graciously and masterfully explain in great detail the inner workings of several key model families from the literature, including a wonderfully helpful analysis of the commonalities across this diverse and fascinating group of MABMs
- Caiani's 2016 paper on stock-flow consistency in MABMs, which provided the intellectual foundations for the base infrastructure here
-
